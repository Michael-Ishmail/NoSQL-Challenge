This is my completed NoSQL challenge project. All of the routes, controllers, and models have been coded, however when i attempt to use insomnia to test the api, the application times out.

I have attempted to find a fix online using stack overflow as well as the documentation for MongoDB and mongoose, but i was unable to find a fix. From what i see, it appears to be an issue with the port/IP. It seems like the database is connecting properly, it just times out when attempting to request data.

Attached below is a youtube link to a demo of my applicaition.
